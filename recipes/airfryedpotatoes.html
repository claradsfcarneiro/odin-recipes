            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground pepper</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat air fryer to 360°. In a large saucepan, bring 8 cups water to a boil. Add potatoes; cook, uncovered, just until water returns to a boil, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a spice grinder, or with a mortar and pestle, combine thyme, garlic, pepper, salt, allspice and if desired, Scotch bonnet pepper; grind to a paste.</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes and pat dry. Transfer to a large bowl. Drizzle with oil; toss to coat. Stir in paste until potatoes are well coated. Place potatoes in greased air fryer. Cook for 8 minutes, shaking basket once. Increase temperature to 375°. Cook until fork-tender and crispy, 5-6 minutes longer, shaking basket once.</li>
